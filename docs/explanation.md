This document provides a complete explanation of the technical task requirements, covering each bullet point from the task brief. The approach combines Terraform and Ansible, following modern DevOps practices.

 Toolchain Used

         - Terraform

              - Purpose: Infrastructure provisioning (VM creation in VMware)

              - Why: Declarative, reproducible, cloud-agnostic infrastructure as code

              - Plugin Used: hashicorp/vsphere

         - Ansible

              - Purpose: Configuration management and task automation

              - Why: Agentless, uses WinRM for Windows and SSH for Linux, integrates easily with Terraform

Modules Used:

              win_service: Start/stop/restart Windows services

              win_updates: Manage Windows updates

              win_feature: Enable/disable Windows features

              win_shell, win_command: Run PowerShell commands

              win_get_url, win_unzip: Download and extract files

              Ansible for Managing Windows Services

 Services Managed:

            Service requiring input: Spooler (Print Spooler â€” typically configured per user or printer)

            Service not requiring input: wuauserv (Windows Update)

Role of Ansible WinRM

         WinRM (Windows Remote Management) enables Ansible to connect to Windows machines remotely.

         PowerShell commands and modules run through WinRM to control the system without needing an agent.

 Automating Routine Service Tasks

     Task

         Module

             Example

             Check Status

                 win_service

                 state: started (idempotent check)

            Start

                 win_service

                 state: started

            Stop

                 win_service

                 state: stopped

             Restart

                 win_service

                 state: restarted

 Environments

       Inventory split into dev.yml, test.yml, prod.yml

     Group vars for shared credentials and settings

 Windows Server Monitoring

          Key Metrics

             CPU Load

             Memory Usage

             Disk Space

             System Uptime

             Automation

                 Use Ansible to run PowerShell via win_shell to query metrics (Get-WmiObject)

                 Optionally install monitoring agents (Datadog, etc.)

Alarming

     Threshold checks with Ansible conditions or external monitoring stack (Grafana/Prometheus)

 Network Device Monitoring

Key Metrics  - Latency

             - Packet loss

             - Interface throughput

             - Error counters

Tools

     External: SNMP, Prometheus + SNMP exporter, or Nagios

    Ansible: Push agent or configure exporters

 Analysis

     Use Grafana  for logs and metrics analysis

Alerting rules for thresholds

     VMware VM Provisioning (Terraform)

         Steps:

             Define provider and credentials

             Use data sources for datacenter, cluster, datastore, network

             Clone from a Windows template

             Customize hostname, IP, and admin password

     Optimal Resource Allocation

          Use num_cpus, memory, and disk parameters in vsphere_virtual_machine resource

          Analyze needs per environment (dev = 2GB RAM, prod = 8GB RAM)

Automation

     Full provisioning via terraform apply

     Template-based VM cloning

    Windows Updates Management

         Automation Steps:

             Use Ansible win_updates module

             Filter by update category (SecurityUpdates)

             Force reboot if needed

             Determine Successful Update

             Query installed updates via Get-HotFix

             Check exit_code of Ansible task

              Detect Failure & Retry

             Capture logs and output with register:

             Conditional task to retry on failure using until/retries

 Antivirus Management

     Windows (Defender)

         Enable using win_feature

         Run scan with MpCmdRun.exe

         Check recent threats via PowerShell

     Linux (ClamAV)

         Install with Ansible apt or yum

         Run clamscan via command:

 Monitoring & Alarming

     Collect scan results

     Trigger email/log alerts if malware is found

 -Git & Repository Management

     -Tools

         GitHub for hosting

         Git CLI + VS Code for local editing

 Workflow

     Git clone your repo
     Create directory and file structure
     Build Terraform and Ansible code
     Commit with git add . and git commit -m "message"
     Push with git push origin main
